# UART_Transmitter_Receiver_Module

## UART Implementation on FPGA (DE0-Nano)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a UART transceiver with even parity, designed and verified on the **DE0-Nano FPGA board**. The project includes transmitter and receiver modules, a baud-rate generator, and a complete testbench for simulation and hardware validation.

## ðŸ”§ Project Summary

- **Course**: EN2111 â€“ Electronic Circuit Design  
- **Institute**: Department of Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa  
## ðŸš€ Features

- **Baud Rate**: 115200 bps (using a 50 MHz clock, 434 clocks/bit)
- **8-bit UART Frame**: Start bit, 8 data bits (LSB first), even parity, stop bit
- **Modules**:
  - Baud-rate generator
  - UART transmitter (`uart_tx.v`)
  - UART receiver (`uart_rx.v`)
- **Even Parity Support**: Added to enhance data reliability
- **FPGA Target**: DE0-Nano (Cyclone IV)
- **Toolchain**: Intel Quartus Prime v20.1

## ðŸ§ª Simulation & Testing

### âœ… Simulation
- **Tool**: ModelSim / QuestaSim
- **Setup**:
  - Generates 50 MHz clock
  - Simulates loopback (TX â†’ RX)
  - Checks received data against expected value
- **Result**: Successful transmission of 0x09 (with even parity) detected correctly

### âœ… Hardware Verification

- **On-Board Loopback**: TX and RX connected internally on one board
  - LEDs show correct received byte
- **Cross-Board Test**: Two boards communicate via UART
  - Board A sends 0x09
  - Board B receives, left-shifts, and sends back 0x12
  - Board A receives and displays 0x12

## ðŸ“· Results

- Simulated waveform confirms accurate UART framing and parity
- RTL viewer confirms correct module hierarchy
- Real-time LED output shows accurate loopback and response in cross-board communication

## ðŸ“Œ Improvements (Future Work)

- Add configurable transmit byte and baud rate via switches
- Include error detection flags (framing, overrun)
- Add FIFO buffer or interrupt interface for enhanced performance
